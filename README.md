# Predicting-Inventory-Consumption
Predicting the consumption of a Red Cross EMS station using a time series analysis with an ARIMA model.

## Understanding the project
This project tackles the usage prediction of personal protective equipments in a specific EMS station. After gathering and cleaning the needed daily data, we used a time-series ARIMA model to predict the future growth in consumption.

## Insights
With COVID-19 on the rise, the data analysis done observed a substantial increase in consumption at the start of 2020. Taking trends into account, our model is able to predict the consumption of equipment as the pandemic's danger increases.
